Relatively new to python. Please help with below description.

Need help writing a python code to open an alteryx workflow and click the run button

I would like this python scrip to do the following.

Open an alteryx workflow located on my onedrive file path, and clicking the run button.  

The files name is "Autonomous Workflow.yxmd"  

I need this to either open the workflow and click the run button at approximately 9:30 am every day of the week.  You can also run a workflow by hitting "CTRL + R"
